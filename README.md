## Working with Picture in Picture (iOS)

Picture in Picture (PiP) playback was introduced in iOS 9. It lets iPad users play video in a moveable, resizable window that floats over the apps onscreen. It brings a new level of multitasking capabilities to the iPad, enabling users to continue playback while performing other activities on their devices. This feature is found in Apple’s built-in video playback apps, and is available to your apps through the AVKit framework. <br>

Applications that support PiP playback present a small button in the lower-right corner of the video playback window. Tapping this button minimizes the video display to a small floating window, letting the user perform other activities in the primary application or even in another application.<br> <br>
